            In this React app, I've compiled a library of animal profiles. Users can interact by liking or removing animals, and there is a handy search function for identifying specific ones. <br />It's a comprehensive approach to learn about different critters from the comfort of your own browser. The animals are carefully organised, making navigation simple. Clicking on any animal exposes extensive information, which is accompanied by a convenient back button for quick browsing.

            What distinguishes this programme is the inclusion of Wikipedia extracts, which provide valuable insights about each species. It is a combination of enjoyment and knowledge!

                Throughout this project, I've honed my skills in React routing, prop management, and navigation implementation. Deploying the app to GitHub Pages was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my understanding of project deployment.
